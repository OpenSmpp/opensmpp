# This is an example of user definition file used to authenticate bounding ESME.
# User consists from attributes, each attribute is on one line,
# each attribute has key and value; users are delimited by one or more
# consecutive blank lines - next user is started by the next attribute after
# first occurence of blank line.
# Comment line can appear anywhere and it's ignored => it can't delimit
# two users.
# Format of attribute is <name>"="<value>
#
# The name and password attributes are compulsory for each user definition
# as they are compared to the system_id and password parameters
# in the incoming bound PDU.
#
# Note that timeout and bound attributes below are just exampples
# of additional attributes and aren't really used by the simulator :-)
# (future expansion?)
# Also note that whitespaces aren't removed from neither attribute name
# and it's value, i.e. "name=peter" and "name= peter" define two different users,
# "peter" and " peter".


# Pavel can bound for unlimited time as any type
name=pavel
password=dfsew
timeout=unlimited


# Jorge has time limited to 10, then the connection is dropped
# if enquire is unsuccessfull
# Also, Jorge can connect only as triansmitter or receiver, he can't
# connect as transciever

name=jorge
password=prtgljrg
# And this timeout is in minutes, bad luck, jorge %^)
timout=5
bound=t,r

# And another users
name=hugo
password=ggoohu

# that's all folks
name=DAMIEN
password=neimad
